      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Who I am?</h2>
      <p>My name is Josue Madueño and I'm a seventeen years old guy that loves writing code, finding solutions to complex problems, and improving on every thing thats related to technology.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What do I like?</h2>
      <p>Even though I already say what I like doing, I think I may be better to explain with a little more detail those things, so here it is.</p>
      <dl>
	 <dt>Coding</dt>
	 <dd>I started coding when I was 7 years old, at the beginning it was curiosity more than anything else. But after some time, it became one of my favorite ways to do spend time. Although I didn't take it to seriously until this year hahaha.</dd>
	 <dt>Chess</dt>
	 <dd>I love playing chess, I'm not very good at it, but I try my best, I really don't know when I learnt how to play chess, it's that kind of thing that you learnt so early in life that is unconscious, like talking or walking, right now I have 1400 ELO at <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a> but I don't have ELO FIDE</dd>
	 <dt>Music</dt>
	 <dd>I love music so much that I listen to music 18/7 (6 hours for sleep), even at university or the bus, I listen to music, I like almost every song, except for the ones that are popular at the moment, I hear them so often in social media that I don't want to hear them anymore, but my favorite musical genres are rock and electro-pop.</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr>
      <h2>Things that I hate</h2>
      <p>I don't <em>hate</em> a lot of things, but if I have to choose, I would say:
      <ul>
	 <li>When someone takes or uses something mine without my permission</li>
	 <li>When I have to wake up in the morning and I can feel the cold in my bones</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2>Life goals</h2>
      <p>I want to get so good at something computer-related that I can live a long and calm life, get married and spend time with my children, I don't need fancy things, but I want to give my future children and wife everything they want.</p>
