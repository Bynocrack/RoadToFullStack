      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Who I am?</h2>
      <p>I'm a seventeen years old guy that loves writing code, finding solutions to complex problems, and improving on every thing thats related to technology.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What do I like?</h2>
      <p>Even though I already say what I like doing, I think I may be better to explain with a little more detail those things, so here it is.</p>
      <dl>
	 <dt>Coding</dt>
	 <dd>I started coding when I was 7 years old, at the beginning it was curiosity more than anything else. But after some time, it became one of my favorite ways to do spend time. Although I didn't take it to seriously until this year hahaha.</dd>
	 <dt>Chess</dt>
	 <dd>I love playing chess, I'm not very good at it, but I try my best, I really don't know when I learnt how to play chess, it's that kind of thing that you learnt so early in life that is unconscious, like talking or walking, right now I have 1400 ELO at <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a> but I don't have ELO FIDE</dd>
